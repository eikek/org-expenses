Tracking expenses in [[http://orgmode.org][org]] files works very well. The org capture
mechanism can be used to quickly insert them. This library provides
utility functions to generate basic statistics from expense lists.

It assumes the following conventions:

- expense items are headings, to be able to apply tags and
- properties where one is a currency code - price pair
- a ~:date:~ property or a date string somewhere undere the headline
  (not really required, but used to search expenses by date)

An expense item is a headline that complies to those points. Expense
items can have one category, which is by default the name of the
parent headline. This can be overriden by the ~CATEGORY~ property.

The date of the expense item is either given by the ~:date:~ property
or the first date that is found underneath the headline.

The following example shows two expense items that are organized below
a "food" headline, which serves as their default category. The second
item overrides this category to "restaurant".

#+begin_example
* food
** groceries
   :PROPERTIES:
   :usd:   25.49
   :date:  [2014-08-14 Do]
   :END:
** pizza
   :PROPERTIES:
   :usd:       18.99
   :date:      [2014-08-25 Mo]
   :CATEGORY:  restaurant
   :END:
#+end_example

All those items are gathered from some org files and tables are
generated to show an overview of the data.

The standard overview for the last example would look like this:

#+begin_example
#+TITLE: Expenses [2014-08-14 Do] - [2014-08-25 Mo]
#+STARTUP: showeverything

Search: ~(:date "2014-08")~

** Installation

Clone this repository and add it to emacs load path. Then ~require~
the file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (require 'org-expenses)
#+end_src

** Configuration

If you have files with expense items, you can set them in your init
file. Either specify a list of files or just a string which then
should be a directory containing org files. All of them are
considered.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq org-expenses/files "~/org/expenses")
#+end_src

Then it might be convenient to assign a key to the
~org-expenses/expense-view~ function. It shows the summary to those
files.

Since these files can grow quickly but usually don't change often,
there is a cache mechanism provided. It uses [[https://sqlite.org/][sqlite3]] and stores
expense items in a database file. If a file changes, it is simply
re-added. You can set the sqlite3 executable if it differs from
~/usr/bin/sqlite3~. Then you must provide a file location for the
database file, otherwise the cache is disabled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq org-expenses/sqlite-cmd "/usr/local/bin/sqlite3")
  (setq org-expenses/sqlite-db-file "~/.expenses.db")
#+end_src

As described above, only headlines with a currency-price property are
considered. The list ~org-expenses/currency-list~ names all known
currencies.

** Expense View Mode

The function ~org-expense/expense-view~ reads the org files and
displays a buffer with summary information of the expenses. It is set
to "epxense-view-mode" that is org mode but with a custom keymap that
makes more sense for this buffer:

| Key    | Binding                                          |
|--------+--------------------------------------------------|
| RET    | org-expenses/expense-view-jump-to-entry          |
| C-n    | org-expenses/expense-view-move-next              |
| C-p    | org-expenses/expense-view-move-prev              |
| C-t    | org-expenses/expense-view-toggle-table           |
| +      | org-expenses/expense-view-widen-date             |

| g      | org-expenses/expense-view-update-view            |
| l      | org-expenses/expense-view-last-search            |
| n      | org-expenses/expense-view-move-next              |
| p      | org-expenses/expense-view-move-prev              |
| q      | org-expenses/expense-view-quit-window            |
| t      | org-expenses/expense-view-search-add-tag         |
| v      | org-expenses/expense-view-focus-item             |
| <down> | org-expenses/expense-view-move-next              |
| <up>   | org-expenses/expense-view-move-prev              |
|--------+--------------------------------------------------|

If this function is invoked with one prefix argument, it will clear
the sqlite db first (if it is used). With two prefix arguments the
expense view is generated for the current buffer (which must be in org
mode).

This buffer is divided in two parts: the first shows a list of tables
with summary information, and the second is the item table. Both can
be configured a little. The variable ~org-expenses/overview-table~ is
bound to an alist with headline - function pairs. Each function is
expected to take a result list and return a summary table to
display. The headline and table is inserted into the buffer. And
~org-expenses/item-columns~ is a list containing property keys of an
expense item that are used as columns. It defaults to
~(:item :category :date)~.

Selecting expense items in the view is done via a plist that contains
4 things: a date range (key ~:date~), an item name (key ~:item~), a
tag list (key ~:tags~) and a category list (key ~:category~). A date
range can be an org date range like ~[2014-05-10]--[2014-05-20]~ or an
abbreviated one like ~2014-05~. The latter is the short version for
~[2014-05-01]--[2014-05-31]~. And likewise, ~2014~ is short for
~[2014-01-01]--[2014-12-31]~. Items must match to all given
criteria. Tags and categories can be included by specifying them and
execluded by prefixing the names with a ~-~. Item names are substring
matches. For example ~(:date 2014-08 :tags ("-train" "journey"))~
would find all items from august 2014 that are tagged with "journey"
but not with "train".

** Other interactive things

There are two functions

- ~org-expense/insert-item-table~ that asks for a search plist and
  inserts a table with all matching items
- ~org-expense/insert-summary-table~ same as above but inserting a
  summary table of the result. If a grouping function is specified,
  the result is grouped first. There are some predefined
  ~org-expenses/group-byâ€¦~ functions that can be used.
