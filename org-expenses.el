;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Tracking expenses in [[http://orgmode.org][org]] files works very
;; well. The org capture mechanism can be used to quickly insert
;; them. This library provides utility functions to generate basic
;; statistics from expense lists.
;;
;; It assumes the following conventions:
;;
;; - expense items are headings, to be able to apply tags and
;; - properties where one is a currency code - price pair
;;
;; An expense item is a headline that complies to those two
;; points. Expense items can have one category, but in contrast to
;; org's property ~CATEGORY~, an expense category is just the name of
;; the parent headline.
;;
;; Then those items are gathered from some org files and org tables
;; are generated to create an overview.
;;
;; See the README for more information.

- :category A single string or a list of strings denoting the
